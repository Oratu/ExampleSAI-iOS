/*
 The parent AbstractClassificationResultsViewController implements few basic steps not relevant to the SAI framework.
 1. The View controller creates a list of all images in Data/mnist_png/testing
 2. This list is used as a datasource for the UICollectionView where each cell represents an image
 3. In the „func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath)“ method 
    the „classify(image:UIImage, expectedResult:Int) -> (result:Int, probabilities:[Float:Int])?“ method is called
    for each cell, with the input of the image that will be displayed.
 4. Based result of the classification the cell is setup either with a red square if the classification result
    did not match the expected result, or a green one if it matches

     Here we simply take the image and evaluate it using the current network. Result of our function is:
     1. „result“ which is an Int from 0 to 9 and represents the most probable digit in the image according to our network
     2. „probabilities“ is a map of probabilities of each digit, it is used in the ClassificationResultDetailViewController
        to show the table of probabilities for individual digits. The keys (probabilities) are ordered, and then the representing digit
        (value of the dictionary) is displayed in a table row.
