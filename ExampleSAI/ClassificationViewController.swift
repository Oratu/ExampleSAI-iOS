 This is the view controller responsible creating a new network, training it and save it to a file.
 
 The parent AbstractClassificationViewController implements few basic steps not relevant to the SAI framework:
 1. Maintains a list of all training images in Data/mnist_png/training
 2. Creates list of samples as required
 3. Update the UI based on current application state
 4. Handles IBActions and forward calls like create and train network to this child class
